The previous AI engineer successfully developed the BidMe (formerly ServiceConnect) marketplace, focusing on core functionalities like dual roles, public access, image uploads, UI/UX, and AI recommendations. A recurring challenge involved API URL inconsistencies, leading to frequent frontend-backend connectivity issues and 0 examples display. The AI engineer iteratively debugged these, particularly fixing  usage and  prefixing. Another significant effort was creating extensive, realistic sample data, which also faced persistence issues due to conflicting initializations and hardcoded limits in the backend API. UI/UX enhancements included updating icons and navigation logic. The engineer implemented AI-powered category selection and enhanced AI recommendations with real business data, including bid request functionality. Despite multiple success claims regarding data display, the user consistently reported discrepancies, especially with dashboard counts and real data usage for contact information, which was later fixed. The final interaction highlights persistent issues with dashboard counts after user-driven data changes and form interaction problems.

The BidMe application is a mobile-first, two-sided marketplace enabling users to post service requests (with optional timeframes and up to five images) and service providers to register, manage profiles, and bid on requests. Key requirements include robust authentication with dual roles (requester/provider), a user-friendly interface with main tabs, and public access for browsing services and provider details via shareable links. The UI/UX must be sleek, responsive, and clean. A critical feature is AI-powered location-based recommendations for service providers, leveraging external ratings and providing contact options.

Throughout the development, the user iteratively requested:
- Replacing service categories with number of completed projects and renaming active projects to services needs on the home page.
- Displaying number of verified professionals on the home dashboard.
- Including a section with all registered service providers, their ratings, and completed projects on the home dashboard.
- Populating the website with hundreds of examples, including pictures, fake accounts of service providers, and verified professionals, to make it appear established.
- Enhancing AI suggestions to use all relevant service request fields (not just the comment) for narrowing searches.
- Ensuring AI recommendations provide a list of 3 potential service providers (on-site or online) with an option to request a bid, including website links and service details in emails/texts for online businesses.
- Allowing users to generate new recommendations.
- Displaying only real, clickable business data (phone numbers, websites) for service providers.
- Fixing the navigation: Browse should point to Browse service providers with filters, and View All Requests should point to service requests.
- Addressing the issue where dashboard counts don't update after adding new services/providers.
- Fixing the automatic scroll-up issue when selecting a date in the service request form.
- Implementing AI-based category selection for service requests using the title and description, and reordering fields (location after category, before description).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing new issues reported by the user, despite claiming prior completion of all tasks. The user explicitly stated:
1.  I added a service and I added myself as a service provider but it didn’t increase the count on the dashboard.
2.  When adding a service, for example when I select a date, it scrolls back up automatically which I don’t like.
3.  When adding a service, the user shouldn’t be able to select the category. The category should be selected with AI using the title and the description. Also put the location after the category and before the description.

The AI engineer acknowledged these issues and began by examining  to address the date scroll issue and prepare for the AI category selection. The engineer's last actions involved reading the contents of  to understand its current structure, specifically focusing on the form rendering logic, field order, and date input mechanism. The goal was to identify where the date picker caused the scroll-up and how to reconfigure the form for AI-driven category selection and field reordering.
